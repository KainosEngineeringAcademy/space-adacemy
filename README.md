# Space Adacemy 2000

The first thing that struck me when I arrived at the space academy was the sheer size of it. It was a massive complex of buildings, domes, hangars, and launch pads, sprawled across a barren landscape. The academy was located on the moon, the only place where humans could train for space exploration without the limitations of gravity and atmosphere.

I had always dreamed of becoming an astronaut, ever since I was a little kid watching the stars from my bedroom window. I had worked hard to get accepted into the academy, passing the rigorous exams and physical tests. I knew it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I was determined to make the most of it.

I checked in at the reception desk, where a friendly robot greeted me and scanned my ID card. It gave me a map of the academy and a schedule of my classes and activities. It also assigned me a dorm room and a roommate.

"Your roommate is Zara Khan," the robot said. "She is from Earth, like you. She is in room 42B, in the Alpha wing. Follow the signs to get there."

I thanked the robot and headed to my room, dragging my suitcase behind me. I was eager to meet Zara and see what she was like. I hoped we would get along well.

I found room 42B and knocked on the door. A voice from inside said, "Come in."

I opened the door and saw a girl sitting on a bed, reading a book. She had dark skin, black hair, and brown eyes. She looked up and smiled at me.

"Hi, you must be my roommate," she said. "I'm Zara."

"Hi, I'm Alex," I said.

"Nice to meet you, Alex," she said. "Welcome to the space academy."

She put down her book and got up from the bed. She walked over to me and gave me a hug.

"I'm so glad you're here," she said. "I've been feeling lonely since I arrived yesterday. It's not easy being away from home."

"I know how you feel," I said. "I miss my family and friends too."

She let go of me and gestured to the room.

"This is our home for the next four years," she said. "It's not much, but it's cozy enough."

The room was small and simple, with two beds, two desks, two closets, and a window that looked out at the grey lunar surface.

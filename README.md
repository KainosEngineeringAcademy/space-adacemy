# Space Adacemy 2000

![alt text](space-academy.jpeg "Space academy landscape")

The first thing that struck me when I arrived at the space academy was the sheer size of it. It was a massive complex of buildings, domes, hangars, and launch pads, sprawled across a barren landscape. The academy was located on the moon, the only place where humans could train for space exploration without the limitations of gravity and atmosphere.

I had always dreamed of becoming an astronaut, ever since I was a little kid watching the stars from my bedroom window. I had worked hard to get accepted into the academy, passing the rigorous exams and physical tests. I knew it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I was determined to make the most of it.

I checked in at the reception desk, where a friendly robot greeted me and scanned my ID card. It gave me a map of the academy and a schedule of my classes and activities. It also assigned me a dorm room and a roommate.

"Your roommate is Zara Khan," the robot said. "She is from Earth, like you. She is in room 42B, in the Alpha wing. Follow the signs to get there."

I thanked the robot and headed to my room, dragging my suitcase behind me. I was eager to meet Zara and see what she was like. I hoped we would get along well.

I found room 42B and knocked on the door. A voice from inside said, "Come in."

I opened the door and saw a girl sitting on a bed, reading a book. She had dark skin, black hair, and brown eyes. She looked up and smiled at me.

"Hi, you must be my roommate," she said. "I'm Zara."

"Hi, I'm Alex," I said.

"Nice to meet you, Alex," she said. "Welcome to the space academy."

She put down her book and got up from the bed. She walked over to me and gave me a hug.

"I'm so glad you're here," she said. "I've been feeling lonely since I arrived yesterday. It's not easy being away from home."

"I know how you feel," I said. "I miss my family and friends too."

She let go of me and gestured to the room.

"This is our home for the next four years," she said. "It's not much, but it's cozy enough."

The room was small and simple, with two beds, two desks, two closets, and a window that looked out at the gray lunar surface.

Zara's warm and friendly demeanor made me feel more at ease in this unfamiliar environment. I appreciated her kind gesture, and her words about feeling lonely resonated with me.

"How was your journey here, Alex?" Zara asked, her eyes showing genuine curiosity.

I took a deep breath, recalling the excitement and the sense of adventure that had initially carried me through the journey to the space academy. "It was a mix of emotions," I admitted. "The anticipation and dreams of being here kept me going. But saying goodbye to my family was tough. We had a farewell dinner, and it was emotional."

Zara nodded empathetically, understanding the bittersweet nature of such farewells. "I can imagine. Leaving behind the familiar and stepping into this new world is challenging. But it's also an incredible opportunity, isn't it?"

I smiled, appreciating her positive outlook. "You're absolutely right. It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance, and I'm determined to make the most of it."

We stood together by the window, gazing out at the desolate lunar landscape. The view was both awe-inspiring and humbling. As we watched the Earth slowly rise on the horizon, I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and excitement for the journey that lay ahead.

The next few weeks at the space academy were a whirlwind of excitement and challenges. Zara and I quickly became inseparable, navigating the complex schedule of classes, simulations, and zero-gravity training together. Our friendship blossomed under the lunar sky, as we shared dreams of exploring distant planets and marvelled at Earth hanging like a delicate blue jewel in the vastness of space.

One day, we were assigned a joint project to design a futuristic spacecraft. Armed with enthusiasm and a plethora of ideas, we transformed our dorm room into a makeshift mission control platform. Posters of constellations adorned the walls, and our desks were littered with blueprints and holographic projections. Late into the night, fuelled by a combination of passion and lunar coffee, we fine-tuned our concept, merging practical engineering with our shared sense of wonder.

As the academy geared up for a grand interstellar competition, our spacecraft, christened the "Stellar Voyager," emerged as a front-runner. The final showdown unfolded in a colossal hangar, where prototypes from various teams were showcased. The Stellar Voyager stood tall, sleek, and ready for its virtual journey through the cosmos.

The competition was fierce, but our creation wowed the judges with its innovative design and sustainable propulsion system. Zara and I held our breath as the results were announced â€“ victory! The cheers echoed through the lunar complex, and our fellow cadets hoisted us onto their shoulders in triumph.

Our success, however, was not without challenges. The demanding coursework and intense training pushed us to our limits. There were moments of doubt and exhaustion, but with each hurdle, our bond grew stronger. We became each other's pillars of support, celebrating triumphs and consoling each other in setbacks.

The journey through the space academy wasn't just about conquering the cosmos; it was about conquering ourselves. And as Zara and I stood under the lunar sky, gazing at Earth from our celestial vantage point, we knew that our dreams of becoming astronauts were not just aspirations but destined realities. The space academy had forged not only skilled spacefarers but an unbreakable friendship that would endure the vastness of the universe.

I could hear a faint sound in the distance. As time passed, it grew louder.

"BREAKING NEWS!!!!" exclaimed a rather lizard-like creature that was rapidly approaching Alex.

"HAVE YOU HEARD THE NEWS????" it said.

As it spoke more and more, I came to a realisation; this was not a lizard-like creature; this was MARK ZUCKERBERG.

"Exposition dump!" shouted Zara.
Mark Zuckerberg is the CEO of Meta, a once glorious company which promptly ended in 2043 during World War Four.
During the war, Mark Zuckerberg (or "Zucky" as he is so affectionally called) gained immortality, leaving him the sole survivor out of all of the Meta employees.
Since he has no money, Zucky has spent the last three years trying to gain back his wealth. His newest escapade is Franta, a knock-off version of the famous Fanta soft drink, which also went defunct during World War Four.

"BLACKCURRANT FRANTA!!!" Zucky so excitedly shouted.

"Wow, I can't believe they've added a fourth flavour to the Franta roster" I said to Zara.

After discovering Zucky's newest marketing ploy, Zara and I returned to the Academy to continue our arduous training.

After a long, hard day of arduous training, I entered my shared room and saw Zara already sleeping in her small bed. Quietly, I paced across the room and gazed out across the grey, empty, lunar landscape and allowed the bright darkness to fill my mind, preparing me for another restless night in space. I jolted out of my disassociative state when Zara let out a small snore, and took this as an opportunity to lie down in my simple, vaguely uncomfortable bed and fall into a deep slumber. 

A quiet, repetitive beeping roused me from my deep sleep. Drearily, I wiped my eyes and reached to disable my alarm, but after some fumbling I noticed the noise wasn't coming from my alarm clock, and that Zara wasn't in her bed. I suddenly became aware of the situation around me. The alarm wasn't from the alarm clock, but from the Space Academy's central alarm system. Outside my window, it seemed every single person and robot at this academy were frantically chasing around in some attempt to solve the issue, and yet I had no clue what was happening.

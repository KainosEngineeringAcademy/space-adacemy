# Pull Request Checklist

You are tasked with continuing the story in this repository. Stories will be scored based on how creative their content is, but also how much is included! The following rules must be followed:

- [X] Only work-appropriate content allowed
- [X] Your story must reference the previous paragraph, creating a seamless flow
- [X] Your addition must not copy any of the previous story
- [X] Each pull request can only contain additions to the README.md file
- [X] Deletions or modifications to previous parts of the story are not allowed
- [X] Your pull request must contain between 100 and 500 words
- [X] No more than 1 image can be added to your pull request and it may not contain the colour yellow

Only once all requirements above are fulfilled, your pull request has no merge conflicts, and you have two approvals from the approved approvers, then your part of the story can be added.
